# Analog Clock README

This is a README file for an analog clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The analog clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands and automatically updates in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Clock**: The analog clock accurately displays the current time, including hours, minutes, and seconds.

- **Smooth Animation**: The clock hands move smoothly to represent the passage of time.

- **Audio Interaction**: Depending on the day of the week (e.g., Friday), the application plays audio. On other days, it plays a different audio file. The audio automatically pauses when the clock stops.

## Prerequisites

Before using this analog clock application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A web browser that supports HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

To use this analog clock in your web application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository containing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the analog clock.

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor or text editor.

3. Ensure that you have the audio files (e.g., `main.mp3` and `fri.mp3`) placed in the same directory as your HTML file or update the audio file paths in the JavaScript code.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the analog clock.

2. The clock will automatically start displaying the current time.

3. Depending on the day of the week, the application will play audio. On Fridays (day 5), it plays one audio file (`fri.mp3`), and on other days, it plays a different audio file (`main.mp3`).

4. The clock hands will continuously update to reflect the current time.

5. If you wish to integrate this analog clock into your website, you can simply copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and include it in your web page's code.

## Customization

You can customize this analog clock to fit your specific requirements:

- **Styling**: Modify the CSS to change the clock's appearance, such as colors, fonts, or background.

- **Audio**: Replace the audio files (`main.mp3` and `fri.mp3`) with your preferred audio files. Ensure that the file paths in the JavaScript code match the new audio file names.

- **Day-Based Audio**: Adjust the logic for playing audio based on the day of the week to suit your needs.

- **Clock Hands**: You can customize the clock hands' appearance by modifying the HTML and CSS for the clock hands elements (`hr`, `mn`, and `sc`).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the analog clock, consider the following:

- Ensure that the audio files are in the correct location and that the file paths in the JavaScript code are accurate.

- Verify that your web browser supports HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Check for any JavaScript errors in the browser's developer console that might affect the clock's functionality.

- Review the code to ensure that any customizations or modifications are correctly implemented.
